# Hackerboxes0015

All the basic stuff is in the getting-started directory. It's likely a collection of code from all over, it's sometimes unlikely that I recall where I found the code. If headers are in the original code-- they are left intact.

	Notes:
		use the i2c scanner library to find your display's address, mine was 0x3C. The code from Arduino Playgraound is in oled-find.ino"

Ring of 24 RGB WS2812 LEDs
	Datasheets
		https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf
	Libraries
		Use adafruit NeoPixel for arduino sketches, again from the library with only one modification to the library header made. (comment out the #error line in the header complaining about the height, there is probably a better fix than that-- but it works.)

Matrix Keyboard 4x4
	Datasheets
		???? I manually mapped the pins below, just pay attention to the orientation I used while you figure out the pinout.
